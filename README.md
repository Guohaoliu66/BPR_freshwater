# Introduction

This project supports a global-scale study of biodiversityâ€“productivity relationships (BPRs) across freshwater ecosystems. 
We compiled 81 harmonized datasets spanning over 30,000 sites from lakes, reservoirs, streams, and rivers, representing six
aquatic taxonomic groups: phytoplankton, benthic diatoms, aquatic plants, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish. Each 
dataset includes species abundance data, functional trait information, geographic coordinates, and environmental variables, 
especially total phosphorus (TP). Data sources include publicly available databases (e.g., Distance Decay 2.0, National 
Aquatic Resource Surveys, Stream Diatom Dataset) and contributed unpublished datasets.

# Raw data
All raw data are stored in Figshare and will be made public when the manuscript is accepted for publication.

Some raw datasets was derived from the following sources:

The authors declare that some datasets were compiled from Distance decay 2.0 (https://zenodo.org/records/6406911), National
Aquatic Resource Surveys (https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys), and Stream diatom worldwide dataset 
(https://doi.org/10.57745/MCKQ7G).
