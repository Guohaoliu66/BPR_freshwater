# Discription

This dataset supports a global-scale study of biodiversityâ€“productivity relationships (BPRs) across freshwater ecosystems. 
We compiled 81 harmonized datasets spanning over 30,000 sites from lakes, reservoirs, streams, and rivers, representing six
aquatic taxonomic groups: phytoplankton, benthic diatoms, aquatic plants, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish. Each 
dataset includes species abundance data, functional trait information, geographic coordinates, and environmental variables, 
especially total phosphorus (TP). Data sources include publicly available databases (e.g., Distance Decay 2.0, National 
Aquatic Resource Surveys, Stream Diatom Dataset) and contributed unpublished datasets.
